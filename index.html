      <h1>Will and Bihl Learn Things!</h1>
      <p>
      We are gonna learn stuff, and that stuff is going to go here! We'll track our progress and build projects on the site. Much like a blog, it will be updated with new things, and old things will be kept available for reference and future readers. Unlike a blog, out motivations are purely selfish and we have no intended value to provide to others (yet!). Hopefully, though, we'll find some value to provide to others and then we can change the domain to <em>willandbihlhaveablog.com</em>.

        We've decided to start off by going through the free course <a href='https://internetingishard.com'>Interneting is Hard</a>. It's relatively short and article-based so easy to move at one's own pace (as opposed to video courses). So far it's been great.
